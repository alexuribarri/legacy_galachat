Legacy Galachat Repository

Galachat was one of the first chats available in Ukraine. Chat was born in the late 90's and rapidly become trendy among Kiev youth.
Initially, the chat was published on the Janus server on the follosing subdomain: http://galachat.janus.net.ua later, it moved to it's own
domain galachat.com

One of the first versions og galachat can be seen here: https://web.archive.org/web/20000706204345/http://galachat.janus.net.ua:80/

Initially the chat was build on CGI (Common Gateway Interface) and user were able to set the time in second to update the HTML chat screen.
Later, a Java version became available with real time updates.

I want to re-create the same functionality of original GalaChat but using modern technologies, like HTML5, CSS, Javascript, Nodejs and MongoDB.
